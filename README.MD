# ORASM - OpenRA Server Manager

A simple web based interface to create/delete, start/stop and Monitor OpenRA servers.
It will auto download AppImage releases from github.

## Important notice

This tool does not have any authentication yet, nor does it support multiple users.
**Add some kind of authentication like .htaccess / .htpasswd in front!**
It also does not check hardware if enough performance is available for additional server.

## Requirements

- Linux
- "screen" installed (required for starting, stopping, monitoring)
- "fuse" availabe (AppImage needs this)
- PHP

## Notice

I quickly wrote this "software" to save me some time managing my servers via console.
Feel free to contribute!
